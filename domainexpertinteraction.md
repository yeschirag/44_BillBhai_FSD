* **Constraints or Limitations:**

  * Lack of a fully centralized system for real-time inventory visibility across all branches

* **Common Exceptions or Edge Cases:**

  * Barcode not scanning properly for older or damaged tags
  * Special discounts applied manually for loyal or bulk-purchase customers

* **Situations Where Things Usually Go Wrong:**

  * Stock mismatch due to manual adjustments
  * Requiring manual intervention for edge cases or specific defect-related scenarios

---

## **Current Challenges and Pain Points**

  * How to unify data across multiple billing systems (Shoppers & QuickBill)?
  * Possibility of a centralized system for all branches to enable better overall sales and inventory analysis
