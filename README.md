#  Retail -- Order Processing & Billing System

##  Problem Statement

Modern retail operations require a seamless, accurate, and scalable system to manage customer orders, billing, payments, inventory, delivery, and reporting.
Manual or loosely integrated processes often lead to billing errors, stock mismatches, delayed deliveries, and poor customer experience.

This project aims to design and implement a *Retail Order Processing and Billing System* that efficiently handles:

* End-to-end order lifecycle (from order creation to delivery)
* Accurate billing, discounts, taxes, and invoicing
* Inventory monitoring, replenishment, and adjustments
* Returns, refunds, and exchanges
* Sales tracking and operational reporting

The system is designed to support *both in-store and delivery-based retail workflows*, ensuring transparency, auditability, and operational efficiency.
